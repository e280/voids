# ðŸŒŒ voids

> app for ephemeral encrypted chats..  
> &nbsp; &nbsp; ðŸ‘‰ https://voids.e280.org/ ðŸ‘ˆ  

**a *"void"* is an end-to-end encrypted chatroom.**  
high-grade cryption for your kinky sexting, forbidden memes.. or maybe just your basket-weaving club..  

**privacy-focused.**  
no phone numbers, no emails, no passwords..  
user-sovereign auth empowered by sister project [authlocal.org](https://authlocal.org/)..  
your authlocal id will stay as anonymous as you can keep it..  

**void links.**  
`https://voids.e280.org/#/v/ES8Y9zBUxsqF6GjZGub5BUXiDM6TowZdQzgPXCUnY775`  
the secret key's just chillin' in the url hash, not sent to the server..  
the link holds the key to decrypt the void, so guard it wisely.. or don't, whatever..

**locked vs unlocked voids.**  
if a void is unlocked, anybody can join via the link..  
if it's locked, they need a formal invite, and can request one via the link..  

**nothing lasts forever.**  
messages vanish in 72 hours.. voids store only the latest 1024 messages.. idle voids vanish in 30 days..  

**cypherpunk vibes.. buildercore energy..**  
read [NERDS.md](NERDS.md) if you want more technical details..
voids is an [e280](https://e280.org/) project.. open source.. self-host if you're paranoid.. post github issues or discussions if you're confused or curious.. star us on github, it's the only way we're paid..
