# ðŸŒŒ voids

> app for ephemeral encrypted group chats..  
> &nbsp; &nbsp; ðŸ‘‰ https://voids.e280.org/ ðŸ‘ˆ  

a *void* is an end-to-end encrypted chatroom..  
high-grade cryption for your forbidden memes, kinky sexting.. or maybe just your basket-weaving club..  

**privacy-focused.**  
no phone numbers, no emails, no passwords..  
user-sovereign auth empowered by sister project [authlocal.org](https://authlocal.org/)..  
your authlocal id will be as anonymous as you keep it..  

**it's all about the void links.**  
`https://voids.e280.org/#/v/ES8Y9zBUxsqF6GjZGub5BUXiDM6TowZdQzgPXCUnY775`  
the cryption key's in the url hash (not sent to server)..  
anybody with the link can decrypt the void, so guard it wisely.. or don't, i don't care..  

**nothing lasts forever.**  
messages vanish in 72 hours.. idle voids vanish in 30 days.. voids only store the latest 1024 messages..

**cypherpunk vibes.. buildercore energy..**  
by [e280](https://e280.org/).. open source.. self-host if you're paranoid.. post github issues or discussions if you're confused or curious.. star us on github, it's the only way we're paid..
