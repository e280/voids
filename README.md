**voids** is a web app for secret group chats
- a *void* is an ephemeral e2e encrypted chatroom
- the server cannot read your messages
- high-grade cryption for your kinky sexting or forbidden memes

your void is as private as you keep it
- anyone with the link can read + post
- share it with your lover, or your friends, or the whole damn internet â€” we don't care
- if your idiot friend posts the link online, shit's public now

anonymous, but you can see who's seen your void
- anon logins powered by [authlocal.org](https://authlocal.org/)
- void keeps a list of every id that's unlocked the void
- this helps you notice if some hacker broke into your meme lair

nothing lasts forever
- voids only store the latest 100 messages
- messages self-destruct after 24 hours
- voids self-destruct after 30 days of inactivity
- no tracking, no data collection â€” no fucking tombstones
