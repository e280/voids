### **voids** is for secret group chats
- a *void* is an ephemeral e2e encrypted chatroom
- the server can't read your messages
- high-grade cryption for your kinky sexting or forbidden memes

### public or private voids
- public â€” anyone with the link can read + post
- private â€” access granted to specific user ids

### nothing lasts forever
- messages expire after 24 hours
- voids expire after 30 days of inactivity
- voids only store the latest 1024 messages

### privacy-focused
- auth empowered by [authlocal.org](https://authlocal.org/)
- no tracking, no data collection shenanigans
- no ulterior motives â€” cypherpunk is a vibe, not a product
- only analytic is the active void count on homepage
- maybe we'll count monthly active users sooner or later
