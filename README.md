# ðŸŒŒ voids

> better encrypted group chats..

**a *"void"* is an end-to-end encrypted community.**  
high-grade cryption for your kinky sexting, forbidden memes.. or maybe just your basket-weaving club..  
users hold the key.. the server cannot see..  

**nothing to identify you.**  
no phone numbers, no emails, no passwords..  
user-sovereign cryptographic logins via e280's [authlocal](https://github.com/e280/authlocal)..  
your authlocal id will remain as anonymous as you can keep it..  

**nothing lasts forever.**  
messages vanish in 8 days.. idle voids dissolve in 32 days..  

**grow your community.**  
a void contains nestable *"bubble"* chat rooms..  
role assignments are bubble-scoped and heritable..  

**into the unknown.**  
creating a void, your browser mints a secret key that isn't shared with the server..  
you send the secret to others via links or encrypted invites..  
your keys, memberships, and invites, are all encrypted in your account's vault, unreadable to the server..  

**the blind coordinator.**  
our database is mostly useless.. garbled messages.. unreadable vaults.. just noise..  
the server shuffles ciphertext around.. only users can decrypt it.. ignorance is bliss..  

**cypherpunk vibes, buildercore energy..**  
for more tech details, read [CYPHERPUNK.md](CYPHERPUNK.md)..  
voids is an [e280](https://e280.org/) project.. open source.. self-host if you're paranoid.. star us on github, it's the only way we're paid..
