a *void* is an end-to-end encrypted chatroom..  
high-grade cryption for your kinky sexting or forbidden memes..  
*buildercore energy.. cypherpunk vibes..*  

**an unorthodox approach.**  
invite ppl with the void link..  
`https://voids.e280.org/#/v/ES8Y9zBUxsqF6GjZGub5BUXiDM6TowZdQzgPXCUnY775`  
cryption key in url hash (not sent to server)..  
anybody with the link can join the void.. guard it wisely.. or don't â€” i don't fucking care..  

**nothing lasts forever.**  
messages expire after 24 hours.. voids expire after 30 days of inactivity.. voids only store the latest 1024 messages..

**privacy-focused.**  
anonymous user-sovereign auth empowered by sister project [authlocal.org](https://authlocal.org/)..

**ðŸ’– made with open source love by e280.**  
self-host if you're paranoid.. open github issues or discussions if you're confused or curious.. star us on github, it's the only way we're paid.. build with us at https://e280.org/ if you're a real one..
