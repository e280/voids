**voids** is a web app for secret group chats
- a *void* is an ephemeral e2e encrypted chatroom
- the server can't read your messages
- high-grade cryption for your kinky sexting or forbidden memes

voids can be public or private
- public voids â€” anyone with the link can read + post
- private voids â€” access granted to specific user ids

user-sovereign, local-first
- auth empowered by [authlocal.org](https://authlocal.org/)
- each void tracks latest 100 authlocal ids who have been peeking
- this helps you notice if an outsider broke into your meme lair

nothing lasts forever
- voids only store the latest 100 messages
- messages expire after 24 hours
- voids expire after 30 days of inactivity

privacy-focused
- no tracking, no data collection
- only analytic we have is the current void count on homepage
