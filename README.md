# ðŸŒŒ voids

> app for ephemeral encrypted chats..  
> &nbsp; &nbsp; ðŸ‘‰ https://voids.e280.org/ ðŸ‘ˆ  

**a *"void"* is an end-to-end encrypted chatroom..**  
high-grade cryption for your kinky sexting, forbidden memes.. or maybe just your basket-weaving club..  

**privacy-focused.**  
no phone numbers, no emails, no passwords..  
user-sovereign auth empowered by sister project [authlocal.org](https://authlocal.org/)..  
your authlocal id will stay as anonymous as you can keep it..  

**it's all about the void links.**  
`https://voids.e280.org/#/v/ES8Y9zBUxsqF6GjZGub5BUXiDM6TowZdQzgPXCUnY775`  
the secret key's just chillin' in the url hash, not sent to the server..  
anybody with the link can join and decrypt the void, so guard it wisely.. or don't, whatever..  
the server cannot decrypt messages or authlocal user ids.  

**nothing lasts forever.**  
messages vanish in 72 hours.. voids store only the latest 1024 messages.. idle voids vanish in 30 days..  

**cypherpunk vibes.. buildercore energy..**  
by [e280](https://e280.org/).. open source.. self-host if you're paranoid.. post github issues or discussions if you're confused or curious.. star us on github, it's the only way we're paid..
